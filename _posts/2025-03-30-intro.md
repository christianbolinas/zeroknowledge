I actively maintain a blog on Wordpress. In the interest of *not using wordpress* I'm going to host it on here instead. The Wordpress workflow was clunky-- I prefer to write words in a text editor, and I previously had to just copy and paste them into Wordpress. That sucked. Here, I can edit text in a repo I have cloned locally, and deploy posts by just pushing changes.
